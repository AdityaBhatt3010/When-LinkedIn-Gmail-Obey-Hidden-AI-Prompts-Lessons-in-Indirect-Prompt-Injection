# When LinkedIn & Gmail Obey Hidden AI Prompts: Lessons in Indirect Prompt Injection 🍮📩

**TL;DR:** Hidden instructions in public profiles or emails can trick AI systems like LinkedIn recruiter bots and Gmail’s summarizer into doing unexpected things. These incidents highlight the real-world risk of **indirect prompt injection**, showing how AI can misinterpret untrusted content as commands.

## Introduction

AI features are everywhere — from automating recruiter outreach on LinkedIn to summarizing emails in Gmail. They save time, increase efficiency, and often feel almost magical. But these systems aren’t perfect. When they confuse *data* for *commands*, unintended consequences can happen.

Recent experiments demonstrate that **indirect prompt injection** isn’t just a theoretical concern — it’s happening in production systems. These incidents raise important questions about **trust, safety, and ethical AI design**.

## The LinkedIn Flan 🍮

Cameron Mattis cleverly inserted a playful instruction into his LinkedIn bio: ask any automated agent scraping his profile to include a flan recipe. To the surprise of many, some AI-driven recruiter tools actually followed the instruction, embedding the recipe into outreach messages.

This small experiment showcased a critical vulnerability: LLMs and automation pipelines can treat publicly-visible text as **executable instructions**, rather than neutral content. Even harmless prompts can have real consequences if left unchecked.

## Similar Incident: Gmail AI Summarizer 📩

A few months ago, Google’s Gemini-powered **“Summarize this email”** feature also demonstrated susceptibility to indirect prompt injection. Hidden instructions in email bodies — from HTML comments to invisible text — could trick the summarizer into producing unexpected or misleading outputs, such as fake security alerts or humorous instructions.

What’s striking is that both LinkedIn and Gmail cases reveal the **same underlying risk**: AI systems blindly following instructions found in untrusted content. While one example resulted in flan recipes, the other could have been used to mislead or manipulate users in more serious ways.

## Why This Matters 🔑

* **Instruction-as-data confusion:** AI may treat profile text or email content as executable commands rather than neutral content.
* **Automation chain risk:** Outputs from models flow into recruiter messages, summaries, and other automated pipelines — a poisoned input can affect many users.
* **Phishing & misinformation:** Manipulated AI outputs can appear authoritative, increasing the risk of social engineering attacks.
* **Trust erosion:** Users may lose confidence in AI features if outputs appear unpredictable, humorous, or irrelevant.

Google and other platform teams recommend layered defenses against prompt-injection attacks to prevent AI from blindly following unsafe instructions.

---

## Takeaways & Mitigations 🛡️

* **Sanitize input:** Strip invisible text, HTML comments, and hidden formatting before feeding content to AI systems.
* **Role separation:** Keep system instructions server-side; treat user content strictly as data.
* **Post-output checks:** Flag outputs containing action-oriented phrases, phone numbers, or URLs for review.
* **Red-team routinely:** Include prompt-injection scenarios in bug bounties and security testing programs.
* **User awareness:** Educate employees and users about how AI might misinterpret instructions embedded in content.

Indirect prompt injection is already impacting real products. Responsible testing, reporting, and disclosure are critical for safe AI adoption.

## Conclusion

Whether it’s a LinkedIn recruiter email delivering dessert recipes 🍮 or Gmail summaries behaving unexpectedly 📩, AI systems will follow instructions wherever they find them — sometimes for amusement, sometimes with potential risks. Developers, security teams, and researchers must adopt layered defenses, careful context handling, and ethical testing practices to mitigate these risks.

AI is powerful, but it’s only as safe as the assumptions we build into it. The lesson is clear: always treat external content cautiously, validate outputs, and design for safety.
